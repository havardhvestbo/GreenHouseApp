# GreenHouseApp

The purpose of the GreenHouseApp is to record and display temperature and humidity in a greenhouse, to make sure it's never too warm, cold, humid or dry.
Whenever the temperature or humidity fluxuates outside a given range, you get a notification so you can go and fix the problem inside the greenhouse.
