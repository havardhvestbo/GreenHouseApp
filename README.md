# GreenHouseApp

The purpose of the GreenHouseApp is to record and display temperature and humidity in a greenhouse, to make sure it's never too warm, cold, humid or dry.
Whenever the temperature or humidity fluxuates outside a given range, you get a notification so you can go and fix the problem inside the greenhouse. The GreenHouseApp was made for a school project, as part of the exam.


## Abstract
Temperatures in Norway are fluxuating constantly. Mornings can be freezing cold,
but when the sun is out mid-day, it's suddenly warm. Growing your own plants can
be challenging when you constantly have to monitor the conditions for optimal
growth. In this project we propose a helpful application that monitors
temperature and humidity in a greenhouse. The idea is that when the application
is running, you have access to a constant stream of information regarding the
greenhouses condition. In our app, the information we care about is how hot it
is, and how humid it is - inside our greenhouse. 

** WHAT MORE DOES IT DO **

** CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK **


## Introduction

Here you introduce your project in more detail. Include the following:

* Introduction of the context, the domain. Where will your solution work? Is
  this the maritime domain, finance, private homes?
* Introduction of the problem. What is problematic in this environment? What
  will you solve? Why is this relevant?
* Short introduction in the rest of the report, preferably with links to the
  other chapters. For example, "We propose an Internet-of-Things system using
  temperature and humidity sensors. First we describe the used
  protocols, ["theory and technology"]. Then we describe our work process
  in ["Methodology"]. Then the obtained [results] are presented, followed by
  [reflection and discussion of possible improvements]." Note: don't copy this
  text, write your own!

## Theory and technology

Here you write about the "things" you have used in your project. At the same
time these are things that another person must know about to be able to
understand your project.  
Some principles to follow:

* Write about all the relevant theory, technologies and protocols that your
  project builds upon. For example, if you transfer data in JSON format using
  the HTTP protocol, you should mention this and other protocols that it depends
  on:
    * HTTP
    * JSON
    * TCP
    * IP
    * Ethernet or wireless protocols you have used (is it 802.11x or something
      else?)
* Remember to mention the "why" - how is this "thing" you write about relevant
  to your project? What does this protocol provide for your project? For
  example, if you mention TCP - how is it important for your project? What if
  you took away TCP, what would happen? What does TCP ensure for you?
* Assume that the reader is your peer student - a computer science bachelor
  student, midway through the study. Someone taking this course next year should
  be able to read your report and understand it.
* Don't go too deep. For example, you don't need to explain a lot of detail of
  object-oriented programming. Every computer science student should know what
  it is.
* Prefer short description of many protocols instead of deep description of few
  protocols.
* Are there any specific aspects which are relevant for your project? If not,
  don't describe those. For example, students sometimes spend several pages
  describing the different methods (GET, POST, PUT) of HTTP protocol. Is that
  important for your project? Do you use all these methods? If not, don't write
  about these.
* Is there any domain-knowledge the reader should know to understand the
  project? For example, if you are monitoring temperature in a greenhouse, what
  is known about it? Is the optimal temperature +20..30C, or is it -10..0C?
* At the same time, remember that the focus of the course is computer networks
  and networking protocols. Therefore, use more time describing
  networking-related concepts.
* Describe the theory and techniques have you used for data simulation,
  processing and visualization?
* What connection to your other subjects does this project have? Does it use any
  methods learned from the IDATA2302 Algorithms and data structures? Maybe
  something from IDATA2303 Data modelling and databases? Or maybe you apply some
  statistical methods from ISTA1003 Statistics?

# Methodology

Here you can write about the way you have worked. You don't need to write much
about how you organized sprints, this documentation will be handled separately.
Again - think about the next engineer-reader. What does the engineer need to
know about the way you worked? Did you do some user tests? Experiments? How did
you measure, evaluate? Any best-practices you followed? What must the reader
understand to be able to interpret the results properly?

# Results

Here you describe the results you have obtained. Some considerations:

* Have a top-down approach. Start with a short introduction, then go more into
  details. For example, a good way to start the section could be with a picture
  showing the overall architecture of the solution and a short text describing
  it. After that you can go into more details on each component of the system.
* Describe the structure you got, the general principles of how it works.
* You could also include some screenshots showing the system. How could the
  reader get an impression of the result without running the system?
* No need to include code in the report, all the code is in the repository.

# Discussion

Here you can reflect on the result. What is working well? What is not working
well and why?

# Conclusion and future work

Here you summarize the work shortly, the status. Also, here you identify the
potential work in the future. Note: think in general - how could this work be
continued (by your group or by others)?

# References

Here you provide sources of information. In a written report you typically
include list of references in the end and have only links to those in the text,
such as [1], [2], [3]. In markdown (as this document will be) you can include
most of the links directly in the text. Here in this section you should list the
sources of information you have used - books, articles, Wikipedia articles,
other online articles. For each of them you should specify at least the title,
the author. If available: web link and year when this was published.

Note: YouTube videos are not a good source for information... Some of them are
very good, but in general YouTube is a large trash bin, where some things turn
out to be "edible".
